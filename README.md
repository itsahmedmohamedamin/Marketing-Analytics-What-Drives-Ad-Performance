> Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR, which represents the middle 50% of the data, is larger for the converted group compared to the non-converted group. This suggests more variability in bank balances among those who converted.

> Outliers: Both groups have outliers, as indicated by the points outside the "whiskers" of the boxplot. However, the converted group has outliers that reach higher bank balance values.

2- **Visualizing conversions by contact**

> Diminishing Returns: Initially, as the number of campaign contacts increases, the conversion rate seems to fluctuate but overall shows a trend of decrease. This could suggest that additional contacts do not necessarily lead to higher conversion rates and might even be counterproductive.

> Optimal Contact Frequency: The highest conversion rates appear to occur at the lower end of the number of contacts (likely between 1-3 contacts), which may suggest that fewer, more strategic contacts could be more effective than numerous attempts.

3- **Visualizing conversion rate by job**

> Variability in Conversion Rates by Job: There are clear differences in conversion rates based on job categories. Some jobs have higher conversion rates than others, indicating that occupation is a factor in whether or not someone is likely to convert.

> Students and Retired People are the top 2 categories that make conversions
