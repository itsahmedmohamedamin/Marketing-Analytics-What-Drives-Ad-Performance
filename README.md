> Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR, which represents the middle 50% of the data, is larger for the converted group compared to the non-converted group. This suggests more variability in bank balances among those who converted.
> Outliers: Both groups have outliers, as indicated by the points outside the "whiskers" of the boxplot. However, the converted group has outliers that reach higher bank balance values.
